'''Maya Save Scene
This Is Especially Ment To Work With Cache Pipeline, Where The User
Builds The Cache, Camera Name Contains Scene Name & The Direcoty Of File Is
Always Set And Definened By Specific Strucure
Here This Script Will Automatically Get The Save Location Based On The
Name Of The Camera And Create A Folder And Save The File Inside If The File
Already Exsist It Will Do A Version Up And Save
