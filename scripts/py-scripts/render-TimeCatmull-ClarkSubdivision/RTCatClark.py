"""
A render-time catmull-clark subdivision script for Maya. Tested with Maya Software, Maya Hardware, Arnold, and V-Ray. 
It should work with practically any render engine inside Maya that supports the Pre & Post render scripts This script 
subdivides any mesh at render time that has smooth mesh preview 3 & reverts it back to the previous state after the 
render is fished. In order for this script to work add this in Render Settings >> Common >> Render Options >>

Pre Render MEL = python("import RTCatClark;RTCatClark.preCatClark()")
Post Render MEL = python("import RTCatClark;RTCatClark.pstCatClark()")

Be sure to add the "__init__.Py" inside the Maya script directory. Also mention the PYTHONPATH in the Maya environment 
where the scripts are stored.
