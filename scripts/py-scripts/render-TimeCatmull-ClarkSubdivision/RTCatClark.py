'''A Render-Time Catmull-Clark Subdivision Script for Maya
Tested with Maya Software, Maya Hardware, Arnold, V-Ray.
It should work with practically any render engines inside Maya that supports the
Pre & Post Render Scripts
This scripts subdivides any mesh at render time that has Smooth Mesh Preview 3
& reverts it back to previous state after render is fished.
In order for this script to work add this
Pre Render MEL = python("import RTCatClark;RTCatClark.preCatClark()")
Post Render MEL = python("import RTCatClark;RTCatClark.pstCatClark()")
Be sure to add the "__init__.py" inside the Maya script directory
Also mention the PYTHONPATH in Maya environment  where the scripts is stored.
